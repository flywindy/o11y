// URL returns raw with any embedded userinfo replaced, so an endpoint can be
// logged without leaking the credentials it carries.
//
// A URL of the form scheme://user:password@host is a working authentication
// mechanism: Go's http.Client turns userinfo into a Basic Authorization header,
// and Pyroscope ingest accepts it. The SDK therefore has to keep honouring such
// endpoints while never writing one verbatim to stdout or the OTLP log
// pipeline, both of which carry the record out of the process.
//
// The contract is deliberately one-sided: a value is echoed only when every
// "@" in it has been positively accounted for as something other than
// userinfo. Anything else — an endpoint that does not parse, or one where a
// credential could be hiding in a position url.Parse does not treat as
// userinfo — is replaced wholesale, because the cost of a less useful log line
// is far below the cost of printing a secret.

// urlUserinfo matches the userinfo of a hierarchical URL anywhere in a string:
// a scheme, "://", then everything up to the first "@". Userinfo cannot contain
// an unencoded "/" or "@", so stopping at the first one keeps the match inside
// a single URL. It is a best-effort tidier, not the safety property — see
// InText.
var urlUserinfo = regexp.MustCompile(`([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9+.\-]*://)[^/@\s"']+@`)

// InText returns text with credentials removed, for text that is about to be
// logged.
//
// Redacting an endpoint attribute alone is not enough: net/url renders a parse
// failure as `parse "<raw>": …`, so an error logged beside a redacted endpoint
// hands back the very credential the redaction removed. Pyroscope's client
// parses the address and returns that error verbatim, which puts the leak on
// the same warning that reports the failure.
//
// The safety property here is deliberately *not* pattern matching. Earlier
// versions of this function tried to enumerate the shapes a credential can
// take, and each round of review found another one they missed: an endpoint
// overridden via PYROSCOPE_ADHOC_SERVER_ADDRESS so it matches no known value;
// an opaque URL ("scheme:user:pass@host") or a scheme-relative one
// ("//user:pass@host"), neither carrying the "://" the pattern anchors on; a
// quote or space inside the userinfo, which net/url escapes so the raw endpoint
// no longer appears in the error at all. Chasing shapes is unbounded, so the
// rule is closed instead:
//
//	userinfo cannot exist without an "@", so if no "@" survives, no
//	credential survives.
//
// The known endpoints and the pattern above run first because they keep the
// common cases readable. Whatever they leave behind is checked against that
// rule, and text that fails it is replaced wholesale rather than reasoned
// about. Losing the detail of one warning costs an operator an indirection; a
// leaked credential costs a rotation.
